                <h1 class="titles">So what am I, exactly?</h1>
                <p class="myText">Buckle up cause this read is gonna be a long ride. <br> We're plural, that means there's several different selves sharing this body. Specifically, we're a traumaendo split-hydraconscious system with atrial memory management. <br> For a detailed breakdown of what these terms mean, please look them up <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Main_Page">here</a>.</p>
                <p class="myText">We're also a therian, more specifically a hybrid of cat and fox with some bird elements. <br> Of course, we'll tune out the animalistic behaviors in a professional setting, but its still a huge part of our identity.</p>
                <p class="myText">As you probably could guess, our internal sense of gender is unusual, too. Having 9+ identities that share this body make it complicated. <br> We're collectively transfeminine, but some of us are masculine-aligned. <br> For convenience's sake, we present using our legal name, but we don't use it in any other context besides professional and legal settings.</p>

                <h1 class="titles">What we do + more details about ourselves.</h1>
                <p class="myText">We like art, but making it as an artist in late stage capitalism just isn't gonna happen for us. <br>For that reason, we decided to sign up at soyhenry, and its going great so far! <br>I think we have a lot of potential in this industry, it's easy for us to learn and get used to new concepts, so we're on a fast track to success. <br>If you'd like to check out some of our less succesful endeavors, such as our Bandlab or our drawings, there'll be links to those accounts at the bottom of the page.</p>
                <p class="myText">Now I'd like to tell you some extra info about ourselves. We're bodily 19 years old, and we have lots of experience doing things at computers, but it's only recently that we're getting into a serious career. <br>Since our sense of identity isn't stable at all, I'll just drop a list of our names and pronouns, along with some brief descriptions of our personalities.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="headlist">Glee (they/she)</li>
                    <p class="myText">They're a tulpa created by our former host! It is thanks to her that we started to understand our experiences as a system. They're the main fronter!</p>

                    <p class="myText">Her main defining traits are that she's a gamer, a lesbian, and EXTREMELY energetic. Gives us a headache every time she fronts.</p>
